# Sorting-Visualizer
This core java application visualizes the process of sorting.
Java Swing library is used to handle graphics of the application.
Bars of various sizes according a certain number in array are drawn
on the screen, which are then shuffled randomly in the background Thread.
After shuffling is done, sorting algorithm starts to execute
and bars are colored accordingly i.e. `currentSelectedBar` and `traversingBar`.

### Sorting Algorithm
The sorting algorithm this Application visualizes is Insertion sort.
More sorts will be added.
